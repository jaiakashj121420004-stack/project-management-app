# supabase/ — database migrations & auth config

SQL migrations live in [`migrations/`](./migrations), named `<timestamp>_<name>.sql`
and applied in order. They are the source of truth for the schema (plan.md §5)
and the Row Level Security policies (plan.md §6).

## Applying a migration

Pick whichever is easiest — they run the same SQL:

- **Dashboard (simplest):** Supabase → **SQL Editor** → paste the file's contents → **Run**.
- **CLI:** `npx supabase link --project-ref <ref>` once, then `npx supabase db push`.

After the schema changes, regenerate the typed client (optional but recommended):

```
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id <ref> > src/types/database.ts
```

> Until you run the generator, `src/types/database.ts` is hand-maintained to
> mirror these migrations.

## Auth provider setup (one-time, in the dashboard) — required for Phase 2

**Auth → Providers**

- **Email:** enabled. For local testing you can turn *Confirm email* off so sign-up
  logs you straight in; leave it **on** for production.
- **Google:** enable it and paste your Google OAuth **Client ID + Secret**
  (Google Cloud Console → Credentials → OAuth client). Add Supabase's callback
  `https://<ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` as an authorized redirect URI in Google.

**Auth → URL Configuration**

- **Site URL:** your production origin (e.g. `https://aurora.pages.dev`).
- **Redirect URLs:** add every origin you sign in from, including
  `http://localhost:5173/**` for local dev and your `*.pages.dev` URL. The app
  redirects OAuth and password-reset links back to these origins.

The service_role key is **never** needed by the app and must never be committed
or shipped to the browser (plan.md §6).
